                    An increased concentration of 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid supports the 
                    diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in a patient who has a compatible 
                    clinical illness and neurological examination, characteristic features on EEG 
                    and MRI and in whom other possible cause of rapidly progressive dementia have 
                    been excluded.
                    <br />
                    The sensitivity is better in sporadic forms of the disease than in variant CID, 
                    but varies depending on the exact mutation and the stage of the disease. Both 
                    false negatives and false positives occur. Viral encephalitis and recent 
                    cerebral infarcts are the most important causes of false positive results, but a 
                    variety of other neurological insults may also cause raised levels.</td>
