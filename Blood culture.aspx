                    Culture in enriched non-selective broth for aerobes, anaerobes and yeasts. 
                    Incubation for 5-7 days, often extended to 14-21 days for suspected bacterial 
                    endocarditis or infection with Brucella spp or yeasts, although there is 
                    evidence that prolonged incubation is unnecessary in suspected bacterial 
                    endocarditis. Growth is detected by the presence of turbidity or haemolysis, 
                    Gram stain, or more commonly production of carbon dioxide, alteration in redox 
                    potential or change in pH detected by an automated monitoring system. The 
                    organism is identified by Gram stain of the broth, colony appearance after 
                    subculture to solid media and biochemical and/or antigen tests. </td>

                    Interpretation:</td>
                <td class="style6">
                    After growth has been detected in the broth the Gram stain appearance guides the 
                    initial choice of antibiotics (which may require modification after 
                    identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing).
                    <br />
                    Organisms usually regarded as non-pathogenic contaminants may cause infection in 
                    individuals whose defences are compromised by immunosuppression, trauma, or the 
                    presence of a prosthesis or an indwelling line. Most pathogens grow within 1-2 
                    days; some organisms may require longer eg, Candida spp, Brucella spp.
                    <br />
                    Cultures are usually positive in infective endocarditis (if collected prior to 
                    antibiotic treatment) and early typhoid. Negative cultures do not exclude 
                    infection.</td>
